# Burritt Research: Custom Data Science Solutions

With 2.5 BILLION gigs of new data created EVERY day, any business that ignores data science does so at their own PERIL.

But hiring a dedicated data science staff is EXPENSIVE and DIFFICULT.

That’s where we come in. 

Since 2005, BURRITT RESEARCH has provided companies with CUSTOM data science solutions without having to hire a dedicated data science staff.

Using YOUR DATA we can:

**==> Uncover your most PROFITABLE products and services.**

Solution from our portfolio: [Predicting Customer Churn](https://github.com/Drimdave/Predicting-Customers-Churn 'Predicting Customer Churn')

**==> Guide team members toward better and more verifiable DECISIONS.**

Solution from our portfolio: [Data Analysis and Visualization of the Covid-19 Pandemic in Nigeria](https://github.com/Drimdave/Covid-19-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization 'Data Analysis and Visualization of the Covid-19 Pandemic in Nigeria')

**==> Build machine learning and AI models that make bankable PREDICTIONS.**

Solution from our portfolio: [Predicting FIFA Player Performance](https://github.com/Drimdave/FIFA-19-DATA-ANALYSIS-VISUALISATION-AND-PREDICTION 'Predicting FIFA Player Performance')

**==> Create systems that reduce RISK across the board.**

Solution from our portfolio: [San Francisco Crime Classification](https://github.com/Drimdave/The-San-Francisco-Crime-Classification 'San Francisco Crime Classification')

**==> Increase marketing ANALYTICS exponentially.**

Solution from our portfolio: [Data Analysis and Visualization of Restaurants in Johnson City, Tennessee](https://github.com/burrittresearch/restaurants-johnson-city 'Data Analysis and Visualization of Restaurants in Johnson City, Tennessee')

**==> Deliver jargon-free reports that ENGAGE and INSPIRE team members.**

Solution from our portfolio: [Exploratory Data Analysis Report of Restaurants in Johnson City, Tennessee](https://burrittresearch.com/wayne-burritt-restaurants-jc-report.pdf 'Exploratory Data Analysis Report')

**(More solutions in our PORTFOLIO below.)**

We can deliver these solutions using out-of-the-box tools, like Excel, IBM Cognos, PowerBI, and Tableau.

In fact, we’re EXPERTS at using these tools to do just that.

But with these tools, we’ll only be able to touch 20% OF YOUR DATA. And that’s because they’re designed to work best with data that’s ORGANIZED and NEAT.

To touch the other 80%, you’ll need other tools -- CUSTOM DATA SCIENCE TOOLS that are designed to work with data that’s NOT-organized and NOT-neat.

We’re EXPERTS at using these custom tools as well.

Is the 80% worth it? No doubt. Buried in that unorganized data soup of blogs, emails, social media feeds, and websites are DATA GEMS. And the fact that they’re so hard to get makes them super-valuable.

But no matter which way you go – out-of-the-box or custom -- our deliverables are EASY to understand, implement, and track -- no jargon or esoteric nonsense. 

And you’ll work DIRECTLY with our CEO, [Wayne](mailto:wburritt@burrittresearch.com?subject=Info), and our Chief Data Scientist, [David](mailto:doyelade@burrittresearch.com?subject=Info), every step of way, from our first meeting to the wrap up.

You won’t be handed off and you won’t have to navigate an anonymous data behemoth to get help.
