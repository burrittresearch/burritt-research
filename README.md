## About

I’ve always been pretty good with numbers. My dad was an accountant and when I was a kid I had to keep track of the hours I worked in the garage. I entered my time in one of those old green 13 columnar pads. I think I was 10.

I guess I should say that was a drag, but it wasn’t. It was satisfying keeping track of what I did. Very satisfying.

After graduating from college, I helped a small ballet company with their books and budget forecasts. Both the books and the forecasts were done by hand -- all you had were columnar pads and a 10 key. When you learn about numbers and modeling that way, you never forget.

Soon after I stared at my first version of VisiCalc and my whole world changed. I feel in love with computers and programming. So, it’s no wonder that I became pretty good at excel VBA and, most recently, python.

Since then, I’ve danced a lot … taught a lot of ballet … and enjoyed my finance related jobs: credit analyst, stockbroker, options trader, equity analyst, financial writer, and financial analyst. I’ve designed tools that help people understand financial data. I’ve also built websites and programmed in HTML/CSS. I’ve written a slew of investment newsletters. I started my own company just to house all this stuff.

My latest chapter has been data. During a recent stint as a financial analyst for a defense contractor, I learned to scrape a ton of unstructured financial and product reports, convert them to usable data, and then analyze the dickens out of them. I did a lot of database management, modeling, and reporting. But I was still in excel/VBA world. I wanted more.

So, when the pandemic hit, I skilled up with data science certifications from IBM, courses at Datacamp, and independent projects. And I love it. If my wife would let me, I’d code all day and night. Python is super cool. And the libraries that these people came up with are mind-blowing.

But I’m still new to data science. And I have a lot to learn. While I bring a lot to the table I need a company that wants to leverage my financial and writing skills immediately while helping me grow my data science and python skills.

If that’s you, don’t hesitate to reach out. I promise I’m worth the effort.

## Project: Kaggle Competition Predict House Prices

* Provided a solution to the business problem of predicting house prices using the Ames Housing dataset. The solution also served as an entry into the kaggle closed competition [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview 'House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques').
* Used a variety of data wrangling and feature engineering techniques to prepare and analyze the datasets. 
* Employed multiple linear regression to build a model using the training dataset to the predict the SalePrice of houses.
* Compared actual vs predicted SalePrice using the model. Results were mixed, indicating the model could be improved.
