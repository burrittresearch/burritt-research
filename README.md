# Burritt Research: Data Science for the rest of us

Welcome to Burritt Research! We'll help you turn data into strategies that touch nearly every aspect of your company's operations, from sales to marketing to finance. And we'll do so in a way that you and your team can understand, implement, and track. No jargon or esoteric nonsense. Just solutions that are effective and affordable. That's data science for the rest of us. [Let's get a conversation started today](mailto:wburritt@burrittresearch.com?subject=Info).

# Why Us

Let's be frank: Unless you're a giant company in finance, healthcare, or manufacturing, you really don't need a dedicated data science staff. They're hard to get, expensive to maintain, and difficult to keep busy on a daily basis. 

But the fact is you still have a big need for the analytical, statistical, and visualization skills such a dedicated data science staff can deliver. And if you ignore that fact, you do so at your own peril. 

That's where we come in. Since 2005, Burritt Research has provided companies with effective and affordable solutions to their data challenges. And we happily do so at a fraction of the cost of employing a dedicated data science staff.

We can help you deploy out-of-the-box tools that work well with structured (tabular) data, like Excel, IBM Cognos, PowerBI, and Tableau. In fact, our team is comprised of experts in each of these tools. And they're ready and willing to get you up and running in no time.

But we don't stop there. When it comes to unstructured (non-tabular) data like blogs, emails, social media feeds, and websites -- which make up a staggering 80% of the data out there -- we can provide the custom data science solutions that out-of-the-box tools can't touch. And anymore, these custom data solutions aren't a luxury, they're a necessity.

And when it comes to the latest machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, our passionate data scientists provide insights that you would have never thought possible, especially on a budget. The fact is we have the best math nerds out there. And they can't wait to get a hold of your project. [So, let's talk today](mailto:wburritt@burrittresearch.com?subject=Info).
